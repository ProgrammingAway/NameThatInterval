# NameThatInterval

This repository is for a project called "Name That Interval".  This project will be a quiz type web application for my wife and her music students.  This web app will play random musical intervals and have the students make an educated guess at the distance of the interval (ex. a 5th, an 8th, etc.).  I will use the Django framework in this project to learn the differences between it and Flask (which I used on the DayBalance App).  This project is in the planning phase right now.
